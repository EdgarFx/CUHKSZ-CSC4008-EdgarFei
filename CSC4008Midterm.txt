Total 8 questions. 10 points each. For problems 7,8, points are explained there.

Briefly answer the questions. Total 80 mins.

You can write the answers using word, or on a paper/ipad. Sumbit them to Blackboard.


1.
KNN, Centroid, etc classification methods corresponds to different definition of distances between a data point 
and a set of points. We listed the closest distance and average distance (and several other distances). 
Please provide a comparison between the classifiers corrsponding to these two distances.

2.
What are the two main approaches in recommander systems? What are the main differences? 
What is the main task of collaborative filtering? When using kNN to
solve the problem, some people will say they are not reliable (or sufficient). What do we do?

3.
What is mutual information and it's relationship with information gain? Why it can be used for selecting features?
Can we use pearson corelation to select features?
 
4.
What is a decision tree? Where do the nodes split? What do leaf nodes and internal nodes means?

5.
In webpage analysis, what are the three parts. Why the content analysis only take the top 500 words and 
ignore the rest of words in the webpage?

6. 
In linear regression, for 2 class problem, we represent class as y={1,2}. For 3 classes classification problems, do we use
y={1,2,3}? Or can we use y={-1, 0, 1}?  Why? If not, what do we use to represent the classes?

7. (15 points)
In support vector machines (SVM), what are the model parameters? what are the support vectors? 
What are the kernels? Why SVM do not depends on the coordinates of data points, 
although the separation lines depends on the coordinates very clearly? 

8. (25 points)
Solve the following SVM problems. X1 = （1, 0）, y1=1.   X2 = (0,1), y2=1. X3=(0, -1), y3=-1.
